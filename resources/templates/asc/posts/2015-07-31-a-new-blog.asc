After torching my old site
(Wordpress, vulnerable, was compromised, bla, bla)
I was long thinking about what to do with the new.
I wanted to make it easier for me to publish new posts, and a bit
more tech savvy, that is. And I wanted to have a static site
that does not expose my server to all the world.

I first looked at http://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] and
http://octopress.org/[Octopress] as they seemed to be the big
players in the field of static site generators.

They worked ok. However I didn't want to learn Ruby if I wanted
to change some functionality. They also seemed complicated for
what I had in mind.

So after a while I ended up with http://cryogenweb.org/[Cryogen],
an easy to use and fairly simple static site generator written
in http://clojure.org/[Clojure]. Since Clojure is the language
I want to dive in deeper that seems the perfect fit for me.

To start a new website with cryogen, first install http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen],
the Clojure build tool, and then type:

.bash
[source,bash]
----
$ lein new cryogen my-site
$ lein ring server
----

This create a new Clojure project from the "cryogen" template.
`lein ring server` starts listening for changes in the posts and pages and
creates a web server that listens at `http://localhost:3000`.

As soon as you change contents or add a page it will re-create the static site in
`my-site/resources/public`.

Oh, and you can write your posts and pages in Markdown or Asciidoc. To use Asciidoc just
add the https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen-asciidoc[appropriate plugin] to the `my-site` project.

To publish the site simply copy the contents of this directory to your DocumentRoot
or a Github Pages repository, etc.

One thing I'm thinking about is adding client side search to my site via
something like http://lunrjs.com/[lunr.js], which seems like a cool
project.

So here it is, a new site, and a new blog. I hope due to a simple publishing chain
I will keep on posting stuff.
