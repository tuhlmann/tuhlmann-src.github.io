During the last few days I got reports from two customers that said the virus scanner AVG reported Simidude as a trojan horse: ![Simidude reported a Trojan Horse by AVG](http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/simidude-trojan-avg-300x166.jpg "Simidude reported a Trojan Horse by AVG") As reported by the install4j people these issues should be resolved by now. You might need to update your AVG virus database if you were hit by this: http://forums.avg.com/ww-en/avg-free-forum?sec=thread&act=show&id=39669 Have a great day, Torsten.
