[Google hosts a video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6909078385965257294&q=seth+godin&pl=true) featuring Seth Godin speaking about Permission Marketing. You could buy the book ([amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841003/104-5590314-9124745?n=283155)) or watch the video which was recorded during a speach of Seth at Google. I must say I'm thankful for every marketing advice I can get. This is not something that comes lightly to software developers, yet it is so important. At least if you have to sell the stuff you produce :)
