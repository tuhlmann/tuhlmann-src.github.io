Dear Dopus user, yesterday I have uploaded a new version of Dopus under its new name, DobuDish. I have renamed the Docbook Framework to resolve a naming conflict with the [original Dopus software](http://www.gpsoft.com.au/Intro.html). This release features new Ant hooks called during the creation of a new document. Now that these things are in order I have decided to release this new version as 1.0.0. As always you can getDobuDish at our [download side](http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html). Enjoy, Torsten.
