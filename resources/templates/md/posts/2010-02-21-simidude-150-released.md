Hi everybody, this is a short notice to let you know I released version 1.5.0 of the Network Clipboard and Drag&Drop utility Simidude. It took me a while to finish this version but I believe I did hunt down and kill some bugs and also introduced some features. The release notes for this version can be found [here](http://www.agynamix.de/blog/simidude-150-release-notes/). You can [download](http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/) or [buy](http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/order/) Simidude [here](http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/). Have a great day, Torsten.
