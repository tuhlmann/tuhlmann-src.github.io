Dear Dopus user and all those who wish to become one, I just release version 0.9.15 of Dopus. This is a bugfix release, with the following enhancements:

-   There is a new property in localbuild.properties which determines the type of the document. The templates have been adapted but you have to adapt your existing documents yourself. To do that please insert into localbuild.properties: document.type = &lt;doctype&gt; where &lt;doctype&gt; is one of <span class="emphasis">*book, article, set, slides, webpage*</span>. The old way is still supported but deprecated.
-   Cleaned up some glitches with the website document type.

Dopus can be downloaded from the [usual place](http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html). Enjoy!
