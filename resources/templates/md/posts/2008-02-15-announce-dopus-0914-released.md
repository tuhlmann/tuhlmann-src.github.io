I wrapped up a new release of Dopus. This release includes a few bugfixes as well as new support for Docbook Website creation. From the release notes:

-   <span class="bold">**Version 0.9.14**</span>
    -   Support for Website creation. The new targets "ws-tab" for the creation of tabular website and "website" for non tabular websites.
    -   If you now create a directory "copy\_to\_output" it's content will entirely and recursively be copied to the output directory.
    -   You can now have a folder "common-files" in the "custom-cfg" folder of your document. If that one exists, common files will be taken from there instead from the global "custom-xsl" directory.
    -   Cleaned up a bug in the generator script that appeared on Linux.
    -   No more warnings when a specific style.css is not available

Dopus is available for download at the [usual place](http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html). Please test the new website feature and report any bugs via the [helpdesk](http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/). Tell me what you think! Thanks for using Dopus, and enjoy!
