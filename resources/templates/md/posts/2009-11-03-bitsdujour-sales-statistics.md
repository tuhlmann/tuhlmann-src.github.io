Our last BitsDuJour day was on October 29 and went were well. That is, apart from the short server outage. Here's their Simidude page with some nice review comments from the customers: <http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/> This is the second time I have done this for Simidude, our cross platform network clipboard and file sharing tool. And this time as well as the last time I'm quiet satisfied with the results. I thought breaking out some numbers about the sales would be interesting for those of you who think BitsDuJour or one of the alternative sites would be an option for increasing sales of their products. On that day I sold about 64 licenses and refunded one. That is actually really great for my current situation. On normal month I sell about 2-5 licenses (which shows that I need to work on my marketing dramatically).

It clearly shows that Simidude's market is largest in the US. From the 64 buyers 30 used Paypal for payment, all other purchases were made with credit card. For those who like numbers here are some access statistics to the BitsDuJour site:

-   The Simidude page at BitsDuJour was hit 3474 times
-   Simidude was downloaded 154 times through BitsDuJour
-   The checkout process was started 111 times- and 64 time it was completed.

Interestingly during my first BitsDuJour day the Simidude page was hit nearly exactly as often as this time. I sold 10 more licenses, a reason for this might be the server outage... Now I hope the numbers help you to make an informed decision whether or not BitsDuJour can be a help for you. Have a great day!
