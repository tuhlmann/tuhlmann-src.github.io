Our last [BitsDuJour](http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/) sale is a couple month back and it was quiet successful, so they invited me back for a new round.

So here we go. This time's [BitsDuJour](http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/) sale will be on October 29. If you tried Simidude and find it useful then this is your great chance to get Simidude for a mere $9,95. If you didn't yet try Simidude [download it now](http://www.simidude.com/download/) so you can make up your mind until October, 29. Simidude comes with a free 30 day trial license, so there's absolutely no excuse for not trying out :) During the last sale I gathered quiet a couple of nice reviews and comments about Simidude- you can still read them on their page... Oh, did I mention? Here's the [BitsDuJour link](http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/): <http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/simidude/> The current version of Simidude is 1.4.0 with 1.4.1 in the making. A license you buy now will be valid for all current and future releases of Simidude version 1. Also one license of Simidude can be used on multiple computers as long as you use these computers as one Simidude group. So if you want to send clipboard contents and files to one or more computers in your house you only need ONE license. I hope to hear from you on October, 29. As always if you have any questions [don't hesitate to ask](http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=request)... Have a great day, Torsten.
