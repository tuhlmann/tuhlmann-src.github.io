After reading much about [Twitter](http://twitter.com/agynamix) and wondering if I might want to join this thing I decided a few days ago that I want to and then actually did. I am in the process of figuring out how to use it effectively and how to provide the most value to my followers. Speaking of which- let me invite you to [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/agynamix). I think I was most compelled to think about the Twitter value when reading a [marketing article](http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/?p=198)on [Peldi's blog](http://www.balsamiq.com/). Well if you want to sell online products I guess you have to use online marketing techniques, right? And one of these is blogging- writing about things and giving free value to your readership. Twitter is like a micro blog- but more so it's a way to communicate with a group of people. You know, we got our first telephone (landline to my parents home) in 1995. Before that I had to go to a public phone and shell out amounts of money to call my friends. See how much the world changed? Nowadays I use [Skype](http://www.skype.com), [Xing](http://www.xing.com/profile/Torsten_Uhlmann2), [my blog](http://blog.agynamix.de), and now [Twitter](http://twitter.com/agynamix) to communicate. For a lot less money to a lot more people. I like technology...
