Hi all, I have just released version 1.1.1 of DobuDish. Changes to the prior version include bug fixes with the new global hooks as well an improved documentation to include all available hooks with a tiny description. Please get DobuDish at <http://cms.agynamix.de/downloads/cat_view-2.html> Enjoy, Torsten.
