I admit, the Simidude user manual was very sparse and lacking much information. I have worked for the last few days to write up a new user manual that will hopefully be more informative for your and will answer more of your questions. Special thanks to very helpful user P. Jansen who provided me with a great starting point for this documentation. The manual is available as PDF from [here](http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=6). I will also include it in future releases of Simidude. Please let me know any things that I have missed in the manual, also if you'd like to see the documentation in any other format than PDF. Download the manual [here](http://helpdesk.agynamix.de/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=6). Have a great day, Torsten.
