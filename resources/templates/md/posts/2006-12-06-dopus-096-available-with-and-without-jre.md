Dopus as been enhanced again. It now includes a "ReleaseNotes" document that tracks changes. Amongst others there are now two versions available, one with JRE, one without. So if you are on Mac or Unix or already have a Windows JRE installed you can save yourself some bandwidth and download the significantly smaller version. Changes include:

-   Support for HTTP proxy if you are behind a firewall
-   Support for multiple Docbook DTD's. Version 4.4 and 4.5 are included, 4.5 is the default now
-   Resolved some problems with Javahelp generation. The document is now indexed and the index is included in Javahelp. Also there was a problem when Docbook titles contained "emphasis" tags.

Happy downloading...
