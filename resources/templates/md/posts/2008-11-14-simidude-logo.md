You don't believe all the steps involved in creating an application! One of those things you forget most easily is having a logo for your aplication. Something your app is identified with. Now since my artistic skills are rather underexposed I wisely decided to hire someone to create a logo. Thankfully the guys at [BOS](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz) discussed this matter in a [recent thread](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.690389.10) so all I had to do was to check out the mentioned and recommended artists. I ended up with [Arslogodesign](http://www.ars-logo-design.com/) and I'm very pleased so far. At first contact you basically fill out some briefing information that tells them about your company/product, your ideas etc. They then develop 5 drafts for you from which you can choose one which in multiple steps would be refined afterwards. Here are these 5 logos: [![](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_1-300x150.jpg "logo_1")](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_1.jpg) [![](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_2-300x150.jpg "logo_2")](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_2.jpg) [![](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_3-300x150.jpg "logo_3")](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_3.jpg) [![](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_4-300x150.jpg "logo_4")](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_4.jpg) [![](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_5-300x150.jpg "logo_5")](/img/uploads/2008/11/logo_5.jpg) After some discussion we settled on the first version. I feel it represents the nature of the application quiet well. Another side effect is that I can use the joint squares as theme for an application icon. Oh well, an application icon is the next thing I need to get done...
