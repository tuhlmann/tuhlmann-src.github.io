SWT (the low level GUI toolkit used by Eclipse and a lot of other Java based apps) needs platform dependent libraries (.dll on Windows and .so on Unix). Normally you have to tell Java where it will find those libs. [This](http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/m92002519.html) is another way to launch SWT applications without the need to set -Djava.library.path to Java or to put the libs into a system wide path. main() would look like this:

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { URL[] urls = ; File workDir = ; ClassLoader cl = new SWTClassLoader(urls, workDir); Class mainClass = cl.loadClass(); Method main = mainClass.getMethod("main", new Class[] { String[].class }); main.invoke(null, new Object[] { args }); }
