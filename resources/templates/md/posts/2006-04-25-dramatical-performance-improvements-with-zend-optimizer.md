I don't know why I did not install this earlier! The [Zend Optimizer](https://www.zend.com/de/free_download/optimizer) (a free download) speeds up your php applicationsin a way working with them becomes smoother and more enjoyable! I have the impression it also speeds up our Java web applications :)
