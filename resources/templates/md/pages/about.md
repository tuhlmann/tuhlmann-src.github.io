AGYNAMIX&reg; stands for “agile dynamic software”

“agile” – we are flexible with respect to your requirements.

Each company is as unique as you are. Uniqueness means to us that we must adapt to the needs of our customers and derive a solution that fits into your IT infrastructure and does not conflict with your established business processes.

Being “agile” means to us that the focus will be on you in the first place and only then on the task. You decide what you want to get – it is your choice that counts.

“dynamic software” – our software for you will be as flexible as we are.

Adaptable. Do you require changes in your IT environment? In numerous projects, we have proven our competence in the building of flexible, reliable and robust software. We are proud of our work and are very dissatisfied with any software error. Software development is our passion!

You will benefit from our clear values:

- We clearly focus on you as our customer and are open to new challenges.
- We set a high value on honesty and integrity.
- We are reliable and offer quality service and products.
- We take on responsibility for our customers, suppliers and employees.
- In all our human relationships, we want to encourage and appreciate.
- It is our stated goal to fulfill the needs of our customers, to treat you with respect, honesty, and integrity as well as to present you a solution that does not maximize our profit but maximizes your benefit.
